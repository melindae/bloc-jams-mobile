- set initial breakpoint at 800 px. Once I shake things out I'll add 360 by 640. Time allowing I'll add more. 
- set background color to change to have an obvious visual cue when the media query shift happens.
- adjusted selling points container to stack vertically ,and adjusted padding to bring elements closer together.
- implemented the top menu and included the 'profile' page in the SPA. It was not added previously.

[Mobile Bloc Jams with animations]

*Purpose*

To explore CSS and JavaScript animations and to learn about responsive frontend development that makes our app mobile and tablet friendly.

*Use Case*

Bloc Jams is great, but we want to make it work on mobile too. Our homepage could also use a facelift.

*Requirements*

*completely responsive - formats correctly on tablets and mobile phones with minimal loss to functionality.
  *Navigation should change according to the size of the device.
  *The layout and spacing of the elements on each page must change to accommodate different screen widths.
*The Bloc Jams landing page should get an update.
  *Animations should be applied when the page is loaded.
  *Information should be revealed when hovering or tapping an album cover on the landing page of Bloc Jams.

[CSS media queries]

A media query consists of a *media type* and at least one *expression* that limits the style sheets' scope by using media features, such as width, height, and color. Media queries, added in CSS3, let the presentation of content be tailored to a specific range of output devices without having to change the content itself.


--- hits breakpoint and shifts to a different stylesheet tablet/phone vert/horiz
--- menu accessible
--- controls usable
--- album info available on touch or hover on album cover
--- restyle/animate landing page - minimum
